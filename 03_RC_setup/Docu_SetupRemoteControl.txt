Remote control type:		Graupner MC-12
							35 MHz FM Sender
							2 control sticks with 2 DOF each
							1 switch installed (controls)
Setup Goals:
	- the throttle should be controlled by the left control stick
	- upon enabling the switch the throttle should go into reverse
	- also for turning the fan left right we are going to use the rudder channel 
	   (set for the right control stick)

Setup process:
	- the switch usually controls both ailerons going up or down completely as spoilers (see "ailerons_as_spolier.jpg")
	- we want to repurpose the switch signal as a signal for the boat to go into reverse
	- in order for this signal to be unique the aileron signal (on the left control stick)
	   cannot be positive or negative
	- we choose the "aileron differentiation" option of the RC to prevent a negative signal for the aileron ("aileron_diff_option.jpg" picture)
	- now we have to set the aileron mix diff to at least +100%
	- if we now turn on the switch the aileron signal 2 should go down but not if we use the left control stick --> we have a unique signal telling whether the switch is on :)
